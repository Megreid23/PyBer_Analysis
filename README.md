# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis, we identified the company's ride share data spanning different city types, their respective total and average fares, how many drivers each city type has and their average fares, as well as narrowed down the data selection to be between the months of January and April.

## Results
The first image is the overall PyBer Ride Sharing Data, based on average fare and total number of rides.

In this image, detailing the percentage of total fares by city type (urban, suburban, and rural), we can see the by far, the urban city type has the highest percentage of total fares.
![Fig5](/analysis/Fig5.png)
We can see in this image that it is matched by the highest percentage of total rides, with each city type closely mirroring total rides to total fares.

Additionally, we can see that there are far, far more drivers in urban cities than in the other categories, which would contribute to these areas being capable of giving more rides and generating higher revenue.

In this last image, we can see the reflection of these trends outlined previously in the data shown over a four month period. Urban has a much higher generated revenue than either suburban or rural.
